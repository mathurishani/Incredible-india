          <div class="text">Jaipur’s most iconic building, the pink Hawa Mahal, stands royally in the bustling Johari Bazaar. With a fine honeycomb of latticed windows, the five-storeyed monument lives to its name, which means the palace of wind. Built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, Hawa Mahal was primarily constructed as a summer retreat for the royal household and was also used by the royal ladies to enjoy the lively vibes of Johari Bazaar through the white framed windows, while they themselves stayed hidden from the people on the street. Interestingly, the arrangement of the windows is said to resemble the crown of Lord Krishna. Inside, there is a museum that houses Rajasthani miniature art and outside is a hub of stalls selling handmade jewellery, leather-crafted home decor items and the region’s famous silver jewellery.</div>

          <div class="text">A visit to Varanasi cannot be complete without a visit to the ghats running along River Ganges. The ghats have been a source of inspiration for artists, film-makers, photographers, writers and musicians for centuries. There are about 88 ghats in the city and most of them are used as bathing sites while a few, like Manikarnika Ghat, are exclusively designated for cremation purposes. As a dip in Ganga is considered holy in the Hindu religion, most of the ghats are dedicated to religious rituals, the most popular being Dashashwamedh. At one end of the line of ghats, is Assi, which is famous for morning yoga sessions. The evening arti (a religious ritual with lamps) at the ghats, primarily at Dashashwamedh, is a sight to behold. One of the more visually spectacular ghats is the Lalita Ghat.

          <div class="text">One of the landmarks of Kolkata, Victoria Memorial is a grand British-era structure built entirely of white marble. Constructed in the Indo-Saracenic revivalist style, using a mix of British and Mughal elements, the memorial draws influences from Islamic, Venetian, Egyptian and Deccani styles. Dedicated to Queen Victoria of England, it was constructed between 1906 and 1921 by the then Prince of Wales (who went on to become King George V). Today, the memorial has been turned into a museum that has 25 galleries.
